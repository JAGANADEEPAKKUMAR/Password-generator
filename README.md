# Password-generator
This is a password generator which specifies the length of and complexity of the password and displays it on the screen.
Here's a description of the provided code for a password generator:

1. The code defines two functions:
   - generate_password(length): This function takes the desired length of the password as input and generates a random password of that length using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation symbols. It uses the string module's constants ascii_letters, digits, and punctuation to define the characters to choose from and the random.choice() function to select characters randomly. The generated password is returned as a string.
   
   - main(): This function serves as the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to input the desired length of the password. It then checks if the specified length is valid (i.e., a positive integer). If the length is valid, it calls the generate_password() function to generate the password and displays it on the screen. If the length is invalid (e.g., zero or negative), it prints an error message and terminates the program.
   
2. The program flow is controlled by the if __name__ == "__main__": block, which ensures that the main() function is executed only if the script is run directly, not if it is imported as a module into another script.

3. The password generated by the generate_password() function is a random combination of characters with the specified length, making it suitable for use as a strong and secure password.

4. The user is provided with a simple interface where they can input the desired length of the password, and the generated password is displayed on the screen.

Overall, this code provides a straightforward and effective password generator application in Python, allowing users to specify the length of the password and generating a strong and random password accordingly.
